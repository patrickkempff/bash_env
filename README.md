# Bash profile for Terminal

A .bash_profile for your convenience. This profile enables colors and introduces handy custom commands to your terminal.

## A quick primer on .bash_profile for mac users

There is a hidden file in your Macâ€™s user directory named .bash_profile. This file is loaded before Terminal loads your shell environment and contains all the startup configuration and preferences for your command line interface. Within it you can change your terminal promt, change the colors of text, add aliases to functions you use all the time, and so much more.


## Getting Started

To install, just paste this into the terminal:

	curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickkempff/bash_profile/master/install.sh | bash

Once the profile has been installed, you can update it by typing the following command:

	bash_profile_update
